        <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Colin Marvin, and I am a rising junior at the university of
            Michigan studying computer science. Some hobbies of mine include: hiking, 
            weight lifiting, and playing video games (notably, I was grand champ in rocket 
            league at one point). I am also a member of the IX 2024 SWE course in Cape Town, 
            and this landing page is part of the deliverables for the program. I am excited 
            to see where this course takes me, and I am excited to use this knowledge to 
            further my career in software engineering.
        </p>
        <h2>Prior Projects</h2>
        <h4>Summer 2023 Projects</h4>
        <p>
            During the summer of 2023, on the eclipse of the AI boom, I created several projects
            that heavily leveraged the usage of OpenAI API, along with training several models and 
            agents. These were then proposed to small companies in the local area, with limited success,
            as sadly I am a programmer, not a salesman.

        <h4>Projects Done in University</h4>
        <p>
            As a disclaimer, I am not allowed to show any code from these projects, as
            they are still being used in the university. However, I can talk about them, 
            which is what I will do here.
        </p>
        <h6>Live & Dead Forensics Project</h6>
        <p>
            This project was part of the EECS 388 course, Introduction to Computer Security.
            In this project, we were given a virtual machine with a linux operating system
            that had been recovered. We were tasked with finding the incriminating evidence
            on the machine, and then writing a report on what we found. This project heavily
            utilized python to conduct various attacks on (instructor created) webstites as more
            information behind the perpetrator was discovered, including but not limited to: SQL 
            injection, cross site scripting, and password cracking.
        </p>
        <h6>Will add the most "impressive" project from each known class</h6>
        <p>Paragraph filler for the above</p>
        <h2>Current Endeavors</h2>
        <h4>IX SWE Course 2024</h4>
        <p>
            In this course, full stack development is being taught. The frameworks
            being used are React and Node.js, and the database being used is MongoDB.
            Along with this, we are learning HTML and CSS, which is what this page is
            written in. Along with this, each student will be undergoing an internship,
            which has a different deliverable, but for the company instead. This page will
            be updated as the internship progresses. I am excited to see where this course 
            takes me, and how impressive of a project I can make by the end of the course.

        </p>
        <h4>WhiteHat.io</h3>
        <p>
            This is an idea that I have been recently turning into a project
            The idea is this: a service that provides baseline security measures
            for a website that is closed source. Because of the security implications
            present with a service like this, any tests will be done on custom websites
            with known problems that pose no liability other than to myself. I thank the IX
            team once again for teaching full stack, as I have been able to make progress on
            the backend, but not an actual interface other than terminal commands.
