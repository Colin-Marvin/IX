            <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Colin Marvin</strong>. 
                This is a landing page currently for a little about me, along with a link to 
                my github! My github is not that impressive currently, as most of the projects 
                I have done that have been put on github need to be private for academic integrity.
                However, I am hoping in the coming months that several projects of mine 
                will be there, along with demos shown on this website as well. Thank you for your time!</p>
